# six-util

SIX UTIL is a collection of reusable Java components. The main parts are:
* Object-XML mapping
* Object-Database mapping

[Castor](http://castor.codehaus.org/) 
is utilized for implementing these functions. 
Castor is an open source data binding framework for Java, and 
the above functions are the intrinsic value of Castor. 
SIX UTIL simplifies APIs for these functions and appends a supplementary framework 
of data search in the object-oriented manner.

Since version 3.5.0, Object-MongoDB mapping utility classes are provided. 
[Morphia](https://github.com/mongodb/morphia) is used for the Object-MongoDB mapping.

> Note: Up to version 3.6.3, 
the code is hosted on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/six-util/).
